    <h1>"What is the difference between <code>absolute</code> and <code>relative</code>?"</h1>

    <h2>What is <code>absolute</code>?</h2>
        <p>The <code>absolute</code> CSS tag is a unit of length. These lengths are usually fixed in a layout for
        one type of screen layout. For example, if a website is designed with absolute measurements, it will look normal
        on a computer, but small and unreadable on a phone.</p>

    <h2>What about <code>relative</code>?</h2>
        <p>The <code>relative</code> CSS tag is also a unit of length. However, unlike its <code>absolute</code>
        counterpart, <code>relative</code> measurements are responsive and adapt to the screen it is being shown on. It
        provides the best flexibiliy across different platforms and devices, making it readable no matter how big or small a
        screen is.

    <h1>"Let's go over some measurements, shall we, zebras."</h1>

    <h2><code>Absolute Measurements</code></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pixels: <code>px</code> | Also known as "picture element", <code>px</code> is the smallest element on the
                screen. It is the standard measurement to ensure consistent visuals across different platforms and resolutions,
                relating directly to a device's display settings.</li>
            <li>Points: <code>pt</code> | <code>pt</code> is the OG, being a traditional typographical measuring unit back from
                the printing industry. This unit is mainly used in print-specific formats, where physical and fixed measurements
                are utilized. This unit does not scale automatically like <code>relative</code> tags do, so content measured in
                <code>pt</code> might be hard to read if not presented correctly.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2><code>Relative Measurements</code></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Parent: <code>em</code> | <code>em</code>, short for "em height" is the unit used for creating scalable and responsive designs.
                <code>em</code> is relative to the <code>font-size</code> of the nearest parent or current element, depending
                on where it is being used.</li>
            <li>Root: <code>rem</code> | <code>rem</code>, also called "root em" or "root ephemeral unit" is the unit used for
                creating scalable and responsive designs. Unlike the <code>em</code> unit, <code>rem</code> is relative to the <code>font-size</code>
                of the root element on the HTML document. This means that if a user has adjusted their browser's default font size,
                the page will still be shown correctly.</li>
            <li>Viewport Width: <code>vw</code> | <code>vw</code>, or "viewport width", is a unit for scalable and responsive designs. However,
                it references the size of the user's browser window. 1<code>vw</code> is equal to 1% of the visible browswer window size.</li>
            <li>Viewport Height: <code>vh</code> | <code>vh</code>, or "viewport height", is a unit for scalable and responsive designs
                and is similar to <code>vw</code>. <code>vh</code> measures the total height of the browser window in the same way
                <code>vw</code> does.
        </ul>
