    <h2>Question 1: What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>

		<p>The difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML is efficiency, practicallity, and meaning behind each tag.</p>
		<p>Starting with non-semantic tags. This usually consists of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags. Though these tags can be used in the same way as semantic tags, it's confusing to look at. Because all the tags are the same, it would be hard to tell what each line of text or code is meant to be.</p>
		<p>Moving onto semantic tags, these tags are more efficient and can be understood, even without the text. Semantic tags consist of tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and more.</p>

	<h2>Question 2: What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>

		<p>Three benefits of ussing semantic tags are, like I mentioned previously, include efficiency, practicality, and meaning or better understanding.
			It is more efficient because the different tags make it easier to establish what each line of text is meant to be.
			With the &lt;header&gt; tag, developers would be able to tell that the text within that tag is going to be a header.
			This also ties into the practicality and meaning because the distinct tags make the whole structure look more organized.
			Overall, semantic tags make the code more understandable to developers.
