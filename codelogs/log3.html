	<h1>Code Log 3: CSS Media Queries</h1>

	<h2>How does a CSS media query work? Why is it useful?</h2>>
		<p>A CSS media query works by applying CSS styles based on certain conditions, such as a user's device or how they're
			browsing the web. Similar to the <code>if</code> or <code>else</code> codes seen in programming languages, if a CSS
			media query is true, then the selected CSS styles will be applied to the document. Else, it moves onto the next line
			of code until one is true.</p>
		<p>CSS media queries are useful because of how accessible and adaptable it makes websites across all screens.
			Imagine you have different outfits for different kinds of weather. When it is sunny, you wear a t-shirt, and when
			it is rainy, you wear a raincoat. CSS media queries work the same way for websites. They help the website decide
			what style to wear depending on the size of the screen. So, if you are looking at a website on a big computer
			screen, it might look one way, but on a small phone, it changes to fit better, like switching from a t-shirt to
			a raincoat.</p>

    <h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries, like "orientation" orientation "max-width",
		and what do they do?</h2>
		<p>Media queries support a variety of media features that describe characteristics of a user's device or viewport,
			allowing CSS to adapt to different conditions. Common features include width and height, which refer to the size
			of the viewport, along with min-width and max-width, which apply styles when the viewport is above or below a
			certain size. Features like device-width and device-height describe the physical screen dimensions. The orientation
			feature detects whether the display is in portrait or landscape mode, while aspect-ratio refers to the proportional
			relationship between width and height.</p>
		<p>Additional features such as color, resolution, and monochrome describe
			display capabilities like color depth and pixel density. Overall, these media features allow developers to create
			responsive designs by applying styles only when specific device or screen conditions are met.</p>
