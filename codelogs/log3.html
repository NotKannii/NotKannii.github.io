	<h1>How does a CSS media query work? Why is it useful?</h1>>
		<h2>A CSS media query works by applying CSS styles based on certain conditions, such as a user's device or how they're
			browsing the web. Similar to the <code>if</code> or <code>else</code> codes seen in programming languages, if a CSS
			media query is true, then the selected CSS styles will be applied to the document. Else, it moves onto the next line
			of code until one is true.</h2>
		<h2>CSS media queries are useful because of how accessible and adaptable it makes websites across all screens.
			Imagine you have different outfits for different kinds of weather. When it is sunny, you wear a t-shirt, and when
			it is rainy, you wear a raincoat. CSS media queries work the same way for websites. They help the website decide
			what style to wear depending on the size of the screen. So, if you are looking at a website on a big computer
			screen, it might look one way, but on a small phone, it changes to fit better, like switching from a t-shirt to
			a raincoat.</h2>
